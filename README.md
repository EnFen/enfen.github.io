## Purpose
This portfolio website was created to showcase me, Nathan Fenimore, with a parrticular focus on front-end development skills which may be of interest to prospective clients or employers.

## Functionality / Features
The website contains 3 pages  - Home, About, and Contact.
I seperated these pages intentionally, to keep functionality seperate, and to keep the visual design uncluttered.
The site includes my photo and information about my work and study history, interests, and technical expertise, as well as methods for contacting me.
The website is completely responsive, allowing for accessibility and optimised user experience on mobile, tablet, or desktop devices. 
Navigation on the site includes links between and within pages, so that users can quickly reference necessary information.

## Sitemap
The relationship between the pages and stylesheets contained in the site can be seen in the following digram:

## Target audience
I hope to attract the attention of potential clients or employers seeking web development services with the website, with the ultimate goal beinging contacted by them with a request for work. That said, I'd love to include some 'fun stuff' in future iterations of the site which would make my profile page an enjoyable and memorable visit for anyone :}

## Tech stack
As at the completion of this project, the site has been built using HTML5 for structure and SCSS/CSS3 for styling. Upon completion it was deployed through Git Pages.

# Design
For site aesthetics I wanted a slight 'Tech' feel. I felt this was an appropriate for a profile page meant to showcase technical skill, but also spoke to my love of gaming and sci-fi / fantasy.

While trying to achieve this aesthetic I first settled on the 'Orbitron' font, which was sleek, geometrical, and futuristic. Soon after, I found a great pairing for it in the 'Catamaran 100' font, which was lightweight, and matched the general shape of Orbitron.

To best showcase the information on the site, I wanted the layout to be minimalist and clean, to fit with the modern 'Tech' aesthetic, and to allow lots of visual space for page elements. This would also assist in directing users to the information on the site that I felt was most imortant (About, Contact). Consequently, I felt that seperating information onto different pages, and having diffiernt layouts for each of the mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes was the best way to achieve this.

To further capture the 'Tech' feel using colour, I selected blues and greys, and then accented these with orange which contrasted well with the blue, and brought some warmth to an otherwise cold palette. Far accessibility reasons, I decided on web safe colours for the orange and blue to be used on the site, meaning the design will remiain fairly robust on devices with a limited colour palette.

With the colour palette decided upon I was ready to create my first asset - the logo - using Adobe Illustrator. The final logo contains my first initial ('N'), a hexagon pattern which can be viewed as a 3D cube representing the 3 aspects of 'Design', 'Development', and 'Deployment', and an arrow reminiscent of a computer cursor which points to the centre of the hexagon which also resembles a 'target'.

Other assets I had to consider for the site included icons and background images. For my icons I used some of the free options from Font Awesome, which (fortunately) matched well with the rounded Orbitron font. For the background image I wanted something minimalist, which wouldn't take attention from the primary content. I settled on a tiled pattern from a CDN site which fit well with the colour scheme and 'Tech' aesthetic.

The final asset I required was my photo. I wanted a candid shot which showed my personality, and which worked well with the sites colour scheme. I also put some thought into how the photo would aid the purpose of the site - so I chose to  pose for the photo looking towards the top-right, so that my eyeline would direct a users gaze, first across the featured content in the center of the page, and then towards the navigation menus in the top-right.

# Project Plan & Process
The timeline and plan for the project proceeded as follows:

Day 1
* Brainstorming
* Researching and sourcing assets (Fonts, Colours, Icons, Backgrounds etc.)

Day 2 
* Design (Wireframing)
* Create Logo

Day 3
* HTML and SCSS for mobile layout

Day 4
* SCSS for tablet and desktop layouts, and site styling (adding in assets, colours, animations etc)

# Q & A
### 1.	Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today
The internet as we understand it today made its start in the 1980’s, originally being established as a means for university computer scientists and academics to network and share information. Some integral elements still prevalent in internet technology today, were standardised in this era including the TCP/IP protocol suite used to move information packets between computers and their applications, and DNS, which allowed for the creation of human intuitive network addressing.

Moving into the 1990’s, the potential of the internet began to be fully realised. Early in this decade Tim Berners-Lee, a researcher at CERN, developed HTML and HTTP which would soon become crucial technologies for creating the ‘World Wide Web’. Early versions of browsers (IE, Netscape) and search engines (Yahoo!, Google) sped adoption of the new technology, and from this point on the previously exclusive networks became available for widespread commercial and personal use. Consequently, an explosion of internet products and services were seen, including shopping, news, banking, dating, health, personal blogging and more.

The 2000’s introduced some of the darker elements of the internet, including the spread of computer viruses, data sharing and piracy, and the ensuing need for internet regulations and security. Amidst all of this, adoption of the internet continued to grow due to integration with wireless and mobile technologies, such as smart phones. The first social networks also started in this decade, which for better or worse meant that we were connected to each other’s lives in ways we had never been.

In more recent years the legal and social aspects of the worlds largest information sharing technology have become more prominent, with leaks of national security information, the need for web neutrality, and how the internet is being used to shape public opinion being debated and discussed. The increasing proliferation of the IoT also shows how the internet continues to permeate and influence our lives.

### 2.	Define and describe the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers
The relationship of the fundamental aspects of the internet can be explained by starting with a web browser.

A browser is a software application which allows humans (or in some cases, machines) to make requests for files and assets stored on other computers. 

A request can be issued by the user of a browser by submitting the IP address of the desired files, however for humans this is most often achieved using a domain name which is far easier to remember than the millions of possible IP address numbers. This domain leads to the information physically stored on a web server.

Web servers can refer to hardware or software. As hardware they represent the location where internet content is stored (or hosted), and  may include other software to run and optimise the information they host. As software, web servers refer to applications that ‘listen’ for requests from clients (such as browsers) and then ‘serve’ the requested information via packets back to the requestor, according to predefined protocols (most often HTTP for the web).

Once the web server has responded to a request, the browser parses the received information (commonly HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and if necessary, renders it to be viewed by the user.

### 3.	Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today
At its core, the internet is about the sharing of information – and there is so much out there _worth_ sharing – but for some users, that information is not readily available in a way that is easy to access, interpret, or understand.
Sometimes this is because the user has some form of disability which makes it difficult for them to see, hear, comprehend or navigate through web content, and for other users, the difficulty may be poor or slow internet connection, device type, or some other barrier.
Fortunately, people who know internet technology have recognised these problems and endeavoured to do something about it. This is the realm of web accessibility and equity.

>"The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect." 
>Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web

Over the years many web technologies have been being changed to accommodate accessibility needs. HTML5, for example, now includes semantically meaningful elements (e.g. ```<nav>, <section>, <img alt=””>```), which in combination with screen readers make it much easier for visually impaired users to access the web.

Internationalisation of websites describes the process of translating web content into other languages so that information is accessible to a greater variety of cultures

Another fantastic example of accessibility and equity is the rise of responsive websites, which allow customised content to be delivered depending on the screen size on which the webpage is being viewed.

Accessibility standards and technologies are governed by the Web Accessibility Initiative or WAI, which is a branch of the W3C standards body.
Thanks to the efforts of these technologies and agencies, anyone, regardless of any particular constraint, has more opportunity to be connected to information than ever before – just like everyone else - and this makes business, society, and all peoples lives better.
