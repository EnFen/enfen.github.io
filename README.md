## Purpose
This portfolio website was created to showcase me, Nathan Fenimore, with a parrticular focus on my front-end development skills for prospective clients or employers.

## Functionality / Features
The website contains 3 pages  - Home, About, and Contact.
I seperated these pages intentionally, to keep functionality seperate, and to keep the visual design uncluttered.
The site includes my photo and information about my work and study history, interests, and technical expertise, as well as methods for contacting me.
Navigation on the site includes links between pages, and to sections on the 'About' page so that users can quickly reference necessary information.

For site aesthetics I wanted a slight 'Tech' feel. I felt this was an appropriate for a profile page meant to showcase technical skill, but it also spoke to my love of gaming and sci-fi / fantasy. 
While trying to achieve this aesthetic I first settled on the 'Orbitron' font, which was sleek, geometrical, and futuristic. Soon after, I found a great pairing for it in the 'Catamaran 100' font.
To best showcase the information on the site, I wanted the layout to be minimalist and clean to fit with the modern 'Tech' aesthetic and to allow lots of space for page elements to breathe. I also wanted to use 'space' to draw users to the important information on the site (About, Contact). Consequently, I felt that designing a different layout for each of the mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes was the best way to achieve this.

To further capture the 'Tech' feel using colour, I selected blues and greys. Accenting with orange contrasted well with the blue, and brought some warmth to an otherwise cold palette.
Other assets I had to consider for the site included icons and background images. For my icons I used some of the free options from Font Awesome, which luckily matched well with the round Orbitron font. For the background image I wanted something minimalist, which wouldn't take attention from the primary content. I settled on a tiled pattern from a CDN site which fit well with the colour scheme and 'Tech' aesthetic.
The final asset I required was my photo. I wanted a candid shot which showed my personality, and which also worked well with the sites colour scheme. I also put some thought into how the photo would aid the purpose of the site - so I intentionally posed for the photo so that I would be looking towards the top-right, which would direct the users gaze across the featued content in the ceter of the page, towards the navigation menus in the top-right.
